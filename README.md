## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
This opens the app in the default browser at [http://localhost:3000]

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
Run `npm test -- --coverage` (note extra `--` in the middle) to include a coverage report.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
